Full Body Workout DVD For Seniors Fitness With Cindy From fitnesswithcindy.com
Steve reeves was the first bodybuilder to put bodybuilding on the map. I call this period the “silver era.”. This full body routine, which was published by grimek after he retired from competitive bodybuilding, is built around a core of basic compound movements but also features a range of single joint exercises. If the classic physique is your goal you’re going to want to avoid programs such as stronglifts 5×5 which has a disproportionate amount of upper and lower body work.
