30sv Nitrosurge Shred Pre Workout Supplement Energy Booster Instant From ebay.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nitrosurge shred was pretty good though, admittedly i started to mix it with some added caffeine to get it to work well but after that it worked good. It comes in handy when you are new to exercising or you are just too tired every morning or evening to workout. Compared to other pre workouts, nitrosurge is a valid contender against mainstream. Overall, this isn’t the best pre workout we’ve seen on the market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
