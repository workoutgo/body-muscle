why leg workout important? Ectomorph workout, Big muscle training From pinterest.com
Hey i was wondering if anyone could recommend a calisthenic workout plan that doesnt require any equipment at all. I&#39;m not worried about my diet so just help me out with a workout regimen. The program calls for you to work out 5 days per week. I am a skinny guy with a little bit of muscle and i would just like to get cut with maybe a little bit of muscle gains.
