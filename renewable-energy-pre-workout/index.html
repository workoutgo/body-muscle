Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. Exeter’s degrees cover a full range of topics from solar, marine and wind generation to policy and governance within the energy sector. First term modules concentrate on developing your core engineering and mathematical skills and address the diverse range of renewable energy sources, their extents and exploitation methods. Renewable energy, much bigger, alot smaller.
