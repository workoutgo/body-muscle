<p>I usually do bcaa's in the morning, pre, post, and before bed. You can take it alone, but better results will come from taking a bcaa formula that includes the other branched chain amino acids. If you exercise and want to effectively use leucine for muscle growth and maximize its effects, you should follow these steps [4]: Consuming protein shakes, whey protein, or eaas after exercise will not only prevent the loss in muscle protein that would occur otherwise (because of the oxidation of leucine) but will also increase muscle protein synthesis and increase muscle.

<p>Leucine plays a role in muscle protein synthesis mostly through stimulation of the mammalian target of rapamaycin (mtor) signaling pathway. This is why it’s necessary to consume eaas in general, and leucine in particular, post exercise. As previously mentioned, the anabolic effect of leucine is not always best for performance in the weight room. However, leucine supplementation (200 mg/kg bodyweight) 50 minutes before anaerobic running exercise had no effect on performance.
