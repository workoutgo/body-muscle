XMark International Olympic Weight Bench with Leg and Preacher Curl From fitnessgearusa.com
Weight plate holders let you store your plates in a neat way. Preacher curls isolate your biceps more than dumbbell curls which makes a difference in how hard they have to work throughout the movement. When doing incline dumbbell curls, you sit on an incline bench set at an angle of nearly halfway between straight up and flat (135 degrees) or higher.since your back is resting against the bench, you allow zero movements in your body. Set to the perfect angle, bench press with ez curl bar positions the arm for a full range of motion while reducing stress on the elbows and lower back.
