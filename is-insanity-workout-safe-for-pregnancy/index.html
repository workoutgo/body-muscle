<p>Okay, so my husband refers to the rediculious amount of weight i have gained during my pregnancy as my baby bulk because for the first 4 months i lost so much weight that my doctor was getting worried about it so i started eating bulk foods (high in good fats, lots of protien) now, 30 lbs later and 9 mos pregnant, i feel disgusting. I've been doing insanity max:30 for about two weeks and love it, but i am now concerned that it is too intense for the baby. I will be talking to my doctor this week about it but i was wondering if anyone else was in a similar situation and what workouts you are now doing in place of the intense insanity. I know how intense it is when starting after not exercising for awhile!</p>
