Dez Bryant Shows He&#39;s Still Ready For NFL Opportunity After Ravens From youtube.com
This video of him doing an insane ab workout made me tired just watching him. More of a trust exercise if you ask me. The former dallas cowboys superstar tore his achilles this past season shortly after signing with the saints, but he looks like he’s really trying to play again. If dez bryant doesn&#39;t make it back to the nfl, we can&#39;t say it is because he wasn&#39;t dedicated.
