In the second round of his middleweight fight against phil hawes, marquez landed a barrage of punches that sent hawes. Dana white cycled his carbohydrate intake leading up to our cover shoot in order to build muscle while losing fat simultaneously. Dana isn’t an athlete competing in a combat sport, so he shouldn’t be held to the same standards as the fighters. Dana white has seen his share of brutal knockouts, but this stunning kick from julian marquez during an installment of the contender series may be the most vicious you’ll see—and that’s according to ufc president himself.
